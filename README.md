## tRPC Demo with React, and Node.js

This repository showcases a simple demonstration of using tRPC for building APIs with a React and Next.js frontend and a Node.js Express backend.

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

**Setup:**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/trpc-demo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd trpc-demo/server
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   This will start backend server on http://localhost:8000/
   
5. Do the same steps for frontend also:
   ```bash
   cd trpc-demo/cient
   ```
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   This will start frontend server on http://localhost:3000/
